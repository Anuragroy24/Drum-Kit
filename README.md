#  Drum Kit

## Description

I developed an drum kit that allows users to play music by typing, combining fun and functionality. This project serves as an instrumental platform where users can create rhythmic patterns and beats using their keyboard. The application leverages advanced JavaScript techniques and dynamic DOM manipulation to offer an engaging and immersive musical experience.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Sound Playback:** Each key press instantly plays a corresponding drum sound.
- **Keyboard Mapping:** Intuitive key bindings for various drum sounds.
- **Visual Feedback:** Dynamic visual indicators highlight the pressed keys.
- **Responsive Design:** Functional across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6):** For core functionality, event handling, and sound playback.
- **HTML5:** To structure the content and layout.
- **CSS3:** For styling, including animations and responsive design elements.
- **DOM Manipulation:** For enhancing interactivity with dynamic updates.
